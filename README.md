# Tiny Tanks Training Theather (TTTT)
A 3D 3rd-person tank training game where you must destroy enemy turrets.

I think a lot of people like me who grew up playing videogames frrom the 80s and 90s will remember some classicÂ old school top-down tank games like Battle City (NES) and WDL: Thunder Tanks (GBC) to have been at the root of many fond childhood memories.

Tiny Tanks Training Theather (TTTT) is a simple 3D homage to such games made using Unreal Engine 4.26 with mostly C++ but also some Blueprint and UMG Widgets. It features sound effects, particle effects, camera shakes, projectiles with physics, and enemy turrets that the player must destroy without getting killed.
